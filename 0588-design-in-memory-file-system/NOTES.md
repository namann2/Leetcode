The time complexity of executing an `ls` command is `O(m+n+klog(k))`. Here, 

- m refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. <br>
- n refers to the depth of the last directory level in the given input for ls. This factor is taken because we need to enter n levels of the tree structure to reach the last level. <br>
- k refers to the number of entries(files+subdirectories) in the last level directory(in the current input). We need to sort these names giving a factor of 
klog(k).<br>

The time complexity of executing an `mkdir` command is `O(m+n)`. Here, 
- m refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. 
- n refers to the depth of the last directory level in the mkdir input. This factor is taken because we need to enter n levels of the tree structure to reach the last level.

The time complexity of both `addContentToFile` and `readContentFromFile` is `O(m+n)`. Here, 
- m refers to the length of the input string. We need to scan the input string once to split it and determine the various levels. 
- n refers to the depth of the file name in the current input. This factor is taken because we need to enter n levels of the tree structure to reach the level where the files's contents need to be added/read from.
