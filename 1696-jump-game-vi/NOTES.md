â€‹Note : There is still an improvement that could be done here using Deque. I have not done it now, since it is way too much information for my head.

## Bottom - up solution  [ TLE ] 

```
class Solution {
    public int maxResult(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int maxScore = nums[n-1];
        dp[n-1] = nums[n-1];
        for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for(int j = i + 1; j <= Math.min(n - 1, i + k); j++) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], nums[i] + dp[j]);
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

What essentially we are doing is, for a particular index we are checking the largest value ahead of it. Can we find it some other way ?
Since we only need k maximum values ahead of current index what way we can do it ?
