<b> Inverse Ackermann Function α(n) </b>

is an extremely slowly growing function. 
For all practical purposes, α(n) is less than 5 for any reasonable value of n. 
This function is the inverse of the Ackermann function, which grows very rapidly.​


<b> Why α(n)? </b>
The reason α(n) appears in the complexity analysis is due to the combination of path compression and union by rank/size. <b>These optimizations ensure that the trees representing the disjoint sets remain shallow, and the depth of any tree is kept very small.</b> The detailed analysis, which involves understanding the behavior of extremely fast-growing functions (like the Ackermann function), reveals that the operations are bounded by the inverse Ackermann function.

<b> Practical Implications </b>

In practical terms, 
α(n) is so small that for all realistic input sizes, it can be considered a constant. 
For example:

1. For n≈2^16 => α(n)=4. <br>
2. For n being the number of atoms in the observable universe, α(n)≤5.
